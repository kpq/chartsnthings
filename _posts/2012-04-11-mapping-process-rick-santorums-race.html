<p>We had a medium-sized graphic in today&#8217;s paper looking back on Rick Santorum&#8217;s campaign. The map was made in R using <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/maptools/index.html" title="maptools" target="_blank">maptools</a>, a package I find increasingly easy and fun to use. For me, the best part about visualizing data in R is that it even when you screw things up pretty bad, the result usually looks pretty cool.Â </p>
<p>Anyway, the map is not revolutionary or anything, but it worked well to tell the story we wanted to tell. I took a screenshot of it at various points in the process (although a small army of people took care of most of the hard parts). <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/04/10/us/rick-santorum-map.html?ref=politics" title="Rick Santorum's Race" target="_blank">Looked great online</a>, too, thanks to that same small army.</p>
<p>Here, making sure I remember how to plot counties:</p>

<p>Sizing bubbles by margin of victory (too big, it turns out):</p>

<p>Getting the colors and sizing closer:</p>

<p>Exporting everything to a PDF so Illustrator can easily clean up the vector work:</p>
