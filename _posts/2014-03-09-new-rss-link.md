When I switched from the old Tumblr to Github Pages, I got a surprising amount of email about my RSS feed.  If I didn't screw things up, it should be [here](http://kpq.github.io/chartsnthings/atom.xml).

Also, for those of you who are curious, this site was created using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), an amazingly easy way to set up static sites. Shan Carter showed it to me in the fall, and we used it for our data visualization [syllabus](http://shancarter.github.io/ucb-dataviz-fall-2013/) at Berkeley and Amanda and I are using it now for our class at NYU. It's great! 

The RSS feed uses [this implementation](https://github.com/snaptortoise/jekyll-rss-feeds) more or less verbatim.
