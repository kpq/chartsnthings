<p>Our most recent addition to the elections app had an analysis of the 33 Senate seats up for election in 2012. Aside from a couple brief technical bugs and, it must be said, a <a href="http://chartsnthings.tumblr.com/post/12982668633/brutal" title="ouch" target="_blank">humiliating correction</a> to the print version, I&#8217;m still really happy with the page. And even after dozens of mockups, it&#8217;s still pretty close to Matt Ericson&#8217;s first sketch (which seems to be pointing into Iowa, of course).</p>
