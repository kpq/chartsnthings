<p>A few weeks ago we published a nice graphic in print about the new universe of campaign finance. Alicia Parlapiano went through dozens of drafts and ideas, but they were all just variations on an original sketch.</p>
<p>Before:</p>

<p>Online, we published a <a href="http://elections.nytimes.com/2012/guide-to-political-donations" title="Guide to Political Donations" target="_self">much different presentation</a>Â that suited the design constraints better. Really large graphics, especially network diagrams, don&#8217;t usually work given our space limitations online.</p>
