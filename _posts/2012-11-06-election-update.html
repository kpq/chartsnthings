<p>The New York Times Graphics department has <a href="http://nytgraphics.tumblr.com/" title="NYT Tumblr" target="_blank">created a Tumblr</a> to post live shapshots of election results as they come in. (For the most up-to-date information, visit the site or the mobile apps, but if you&#8217;re just a Tumblr user, you can find updates there too.)<br/><br/>While results are coming in, we&#8217;ll be posting electoral maps from elections past – starting with the year 1896.<br/><br/><img align="middle" alt="old map" src="http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_md1rmdl9rI1rkq3z4o1_r1_1280.png" width="1280"/><br/><br/>So check it out!  <br/><br/>PS ChartsNThings is a year old! Yesterday, actually. Yesterday, actually.<br/><br/>I do have a bunch of politics sketches to share (mostly from Mike Bostock, Shan Carter and Amanda Cox), and I do have some more substantive plans for the blog that I will get to later, but we&#8217;re pretty busy with the election these days, so it will have to wait.<br/><br/></p>
