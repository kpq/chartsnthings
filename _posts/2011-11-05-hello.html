<p>I&#8217;ll use this blog to show some aspects of the work of the <a title="New York Times Graphics on Twitter" target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/#!/nytgraphics">New York Times Graphics Department</a>, where I work as a staff editor. I also teach a class with Amanda Cox about data journalism at NYU&#8217;s <a title="SHERP" target="_blank" href="http://journalism.nyu.edu/graduate/courses-of-study/science-health-and-environmental-reporting/">Science, Health and Environmental Journalism Program</a>, so I&#8217;ll post about internships and student work sometimes too. I&#8217;m also working on a post about a dream side of the 11 best bald men to ever play professional soccer, since you asked. (Zidane, of course; Arjen Robben, if he&#8217;s healthy; in net, Brad Friedel, Kasey Keller or none of the above?)</p>
