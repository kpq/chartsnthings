<p>Probably the best-known of the department&#8217;s graphics this election season is Mike Bostock and Shan Carter&#8217;s <a href="http://elections.nytimes.com/2012/results/president/scenarios" title="512 paths link" target="_blank">512 Paths to the White House</a>. Instead of posting on this in detail, I&#8217;ll just put up a few images and direct you to some stuff that&#8217;s already out there.</p>
<p>First, an <a href="http://source.mozillaopennews.org/en-US/articles/nyts-512-paths-white-house/" title="Source interview" target="_blank">interview on Source</a> with the authors. </p>
<p>Next, Shan Carter&#8217;s <a href="http://shancarter.com/talk/2012/visualized/" title="Vizualized" target="_blank">recent talk at the Visualized conference</a> in New York. (There was apparently a burst of applause when the first slides for this graphic came on the screen.)</p>
<p>These photos are from that talk, but there are dozens more if you read through the whole thing, which you should, obv.</p>

<p><img alt="s2" height="569" src="http://shancarter.com/talk/2012/visualized/slides/p240.png" width="951"/></p>
<p>And the <a href="http://elections.nytimes.com/2012/results/president/scenarios" title="final link" target="_blank">final graphic</a>, which was wired up to results on election night.</p>
<p><a href="http://elections.nytimes.com/2012/results/president/scenarios" title="linky"><img align="middle" alt="final" src="http://shancarter.com/talk/2012/visualized/slides/p0.png" width="2002"/></a>The only meaningful footnote I can add to this is that Mike Bostock described programming the animations as &#8220;really, really hard.&#8221; I read that to mean I need to give up programming immediately, but your mileage may vary.</p>
