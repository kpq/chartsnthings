<p>From a chat transcript with Amanda Cox this morning (with permission). <img alt="image" class="top-buffer" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5339/9348291078_206b7a9866_b.jpg"/></p>
<p>The spirit-lifting content she is describing is the print version of this <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/22/business/in-climbing-income-ladder-location-matters.html">interactive article</a>, for lack of a better word, about income mobility, mostly developed by Amanda and Shan Carter. Subway man&#8217;s fingers were tracing this chart: <img alt="image" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5483/9348212504_4617e8f6d5_o.png"/></p>
<p>It&#8217;s always hard watching print readers, most of whom are ruthless scanners, come across something you made; I&#8217;m glad it appears to have worked out. It goes without saying that &#8220;winning&#8221; Amanda is preferable to &#8220;spirits fell&#8221; Amanda by all parties everywhere.</p>
