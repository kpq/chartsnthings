<p>The New York Times Graphics Department was one of 10 recipients of the <a href="http://journalism.missouri.edu/2012/07/2012-recipients-of-the-missouri-honor-medal-for-distinguished-service-in-journalism-announced/" title="Missouri Honor Medal" target="_blank">2012 Missouri Honor Medal</a>. For some reason the school was not able to fly all 25 of us to mid-Missouri for the banquet, so, as the lone Mizzou grad on staff, they sent me to come pick it up. </p>

<p>Nice hardware! (Though sad they didn&#8217;t make 25 of them&#8230;)</p>
<p>I also gave a <a href="http://kevinquealy.com/slides/missouri-10-15-12/" title="FOUC-y slides" target="_blank">talk to students</a> about the work the department does. It&#8217;s probably too sports-heavy in retrospect, but almost every student here was wearing Cardinals gear, so maybe it&#8217;s a wash. Also it&#8217;s the first time I used Mike Bostock&#8217;s <a href="http://mbostock.github.com/stack/" title="stack" target="_blank">Stack.js</a> and I&#8217;m almost positive I did it wrong, so don&#8217;t pop the hood, for your own sake.</p>
