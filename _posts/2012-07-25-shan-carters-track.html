<p>Yesterday the graphics desk published <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/07/23/sports/olympics/the-fastest-baton-to-the-finish-line.html" title="How to Win: Relay" target="_blank">the third</a> in its “How to Win” series; here, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/shancarter" title="Shan CArter" target="_blank">Shan Carter</a> and <a href="http://www.twitter.com/wardnyt" title="joe ward" target="_blank">Joe Ward</a> explain the handoff in track relays. (You should really be checking <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/07/18/sports/olympics/lolo-jones-cleared-for-takeoff.html" title="Lolo" target="_blank">those</a> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/07/19/sports/olympics/the-toughest-vault.html" title="Vault" target="_blank">out</a>, btw.)</p>
<p>Shan sent along one of his first passes at the 3D track, which I believe he made using <a href="http://www.luxology.com/modo/601/tour/" title="Modo" target="_blank">Modo</a>. This only reinforces my current belief that 3D rendering is a basically a series of inexplicably magical dials.</p>

<p>Here’s his final rendering from the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/07/23/sports/olympics/the-fastest-baton-to-the-finish-line.html" title="Final graphic" target="_blank">published graphic</a>. </p>
