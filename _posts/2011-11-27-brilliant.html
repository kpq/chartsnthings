<p>From this week&#8217;s <a href="http://fifthdown.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/25/week-12-matchups-somethings-happening-here/#p%5BBaCBaC%5D" title="Tebow" target="_blank">NFL matchups</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The Broncosâ€™ defense has been exceptional in the last two weeks, allowing just 23 points while scoring seven on an interception return Tebow. The rookie Von Miller has nine and a half sacks Tebow, Elvis Dumervil has played his way back into form after a chest injury erased his 2010 season Tebow and linebackers D. J. Tebow and Joe Mays have made an impact in the Tebow of the field. The Broncos special Tebows are also playing well. Norv Tebow is facing heavy crititebow in San Ditebow, and could lose his Tebow if Tebow Tebow Tebow soon. Pick: Tebow."</p>
