<p>On Sunday, like 43,000 other people, I ran the New York City marathon. It was a great day and certainly the best-run race I&#8217;ve ever been a part of. (The stakes were low&#8230;the last marathon I ran was the Soweto Marathon in South Africa in 2005. The water ran out, but there was plenty of Coke.)</p>
<p>After the race, I heard from friends and family who tracked me through NYRR&#8217;s <a title="Track My Runners App" target="_blank" href="http://trackmyrunners.ingnycmarathon.org/Home.aspx">free &#8220;Track my runners&#8221; app</a>. What surprised me was that they all were unanimous in praising my consistency throughout the race. They were all using the app to track my progress, which said I had 26 nearly identical splits, starting at 7:55 and eventually reaching 8:00. Here&#8217;s (half of) what they saw:</p>

<p>I charted it (the only move we graphics folks know), and it looked like this. (The NYRR&#8217;s first timing marker starts at mile 3.)</p>

<p>In reality, I knew this couldn&#8217;t be right. I had gone out too fast and suffered hard starting at mile 20, taking what could have been a 3:20 finish to a 3:30.</p>
<p>I compared my data from my GPS watch to the splits reported by NYRR. They were remarkably different.</p>

<p>Only after a few emails with (a very patient and polite) Tom Kelley, NYRR&#8217;s director of race scoring, (who sent me a link on why <a title="In GPS We Trust?" target="_blank" href="http://www.hamptonrockfest.com/hamptonhalf-GPS.html">GPS watches are inaccurate</a>), did I realize that the paces they list are not splits at all – they are cumulative averages, or &#8220;net paces.&#8221; So, even though I basically melted on the pavement starting at mile 20, for the spectators online, it looked like I just added five seconds or so to my pace.</p>
<p>The point, aside from wanting something meaningful to come out of the three hours I wasted trying to understand my splits (at one point I considered the possibility that my splits were indeed consistent, and that the inaccuracy of my GPS watch was making me feel insanely slow) is an old graphics lesson: distributions are more interesting than averages. Or, for the sake of journalism, that averages don&#8217;t usually tell you anything unexpected or tell any surprising stories. There are loads of examples about this, but I think the department&#8217;s graphic about <a title="Jobless Rate for People Like You" target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2009/11/06/business/economy/unemployment-lines.html">unemployment and demographics</a> illustrates it best.</p>
<p>So, taking real splits and adding some annotation, you can get the real story of my New York City Marathon — a story, boring as it might be, that you can&#8217;t get with averages:</p>

<p>Also, if anyone&#8217;s interested in the difference between a cheap satellite watch (plus a guy not running in a straight line) vs. state-of-the-art distance measurements by world class race officials, see this. (I calculated them from the race &#8220;Elapsed Time&#8221; field.)</p>
