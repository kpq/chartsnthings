<p>Elisabeth Bumiller&#8217;s <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/22/style/jeremy-bernard-white-house-social-secretary-makes-his-mark.html" title="story" target="_blank">recent profile</a> of Jeremy Bernard, the first man and openly gay person to be the White House social secretary, used an interesting dataset: a list of everyone who has attended a state dinner in the Obama administration. I don&#8217;t have a ton of experience with Styles (or with &#8220;style&#8221;, for that matter), but this was a good chance to do something different with a new section. Except not that different, since charts are pretty much the only trick.</p>
<p>Alicia Parlapiano and I ended up using a sort of spiral plot, which we then just joined together in illustrator. I remembered that we had used a similar technique in one of my first graphics at the Times to visualize <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2008/08/17/sports/olympics/20080817-goldmedals-graphic.html" title="Who's good at what" target="_blank">which countries were good at which sports</a>. (Then, as now, Amanda did the hard stuff.) So I ported the code from Actionscript to use for this, while also sizing for frequency of visits.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the sketch:</p>

<p>And how it looked in print:</p>

<p>Matt Ericson and Amanda Cox helped out on a late night to make a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/04/22/style/people-invited-to-state-dinners.html" title="among his duties..." target="_blank">fun interactive</a> version, perfect for gawking at all those people who were invited instead of you.Â </p>
