<p>Readers, aggregators and bored skimmers of chartsnthings will know that this is frequently a place for statistical sketches, many of which are made in R. Yet this is not because the New York Times Graphics department only makes statistical charts; more realistically, it&#8217;s because this blog&#8217;s frequent contributors stink at drawing. The department has a wide assortment of (frankly badass) illustrators, cartographers and 3D modelers, and I&#8217;ll try to include some more of their sketches in future posts. </p>
<p>In that spirit, my colleague <a href="http://www.twitter.com/aliciadesantis" title="Alicia Twitter" target="_blank">Alicia Desantis</a> agreed to share sketches from her recent Thanksgiving flow chart of turkey preparation decisions.</p>
<p>From Alicia:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our original idea was to qualify 80 different turkey combinations. What&#8217;s the difference between a heritage bird that is roasted whole, brined and air-dried and one that is butterflied, brined and air-dried? Supposedly these decisions have consequences, right? The final turkeys would be rated in a number of factors: juiciness, crispness, cost, time-prep etc. </p>
<p>But this way of thinking about the story severely limited the number of variables and bogged us down in meaningless differences. So we moved to a decision chart — this way we could more clearly articulate what was at stake in each individual cooking choice. It also left some room for basic &#8220;tips&#8221; and commentary — and gave us an opportunity to experiment with a different voice. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Instead of not talking to your family at the Thanksgiving table, why not take a look through her design process? First, some thoughts in Illustrator&#8230;</p>
