<p>I was cleaning out my desk today and came across some sketches from some graphics we&#8217;ve published in the last year. Here&#8217;s a sketch drawn by Mike McIntire, an investigative reporter, as he described to me <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/31/us/politics/31liberty.html?_r=1" title="Odd Alliance: Business Lobby and Tea Party" target="_blank">his story</a> about the ties between a Tea Party group and an Asian Paper Company. (When someone needs to draw something to explain the story to you, it&#8217;s a good sign that the story needs a graphic.)</p>
