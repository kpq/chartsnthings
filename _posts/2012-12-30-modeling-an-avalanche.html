<p>Last week I <a href="http://chartsnthings.tumblr.com/post/38556382963/making-a-mountain-out-of-a-mountain-of-data" title="data mountain" target="_blank">posted a video</a> from Jeremy White, loosely describing how he turned LIDAR data into a stunning model of Tunnel Creek. But more modeling yet went into showing exactly where the avalanche happened and how it traveled. My colleague <a href="http://www.twitter.com/grahaphics">Graham Roberts</a> added trees, elevation lines and an actual model of the avalanche – its shape, depth, and size — as it flowed down the mountain. (The <a href="http://www.slf.ch/english_EN" title="Swiss Federal Institute" target="_blank">Swiss Federal Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research</a> created the model specifically for this project.)</p>
<p>Below, a set of drafts that show the animation at various points along completion. These are courtesy of Graham, who rendered these in 3D, and <a href="http://www.twitter.com/hfairfield" title="Hannah" target="_blank">Hannah Fairfield</a>, one of the project&#8217;s editors.</p>

<p>Contrast these to the version that made it into the project (I failed at internet in trying to post that video here, but it looks better on the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/projects/2012/snow-fall/#/?part=blur-of-white" title="Blur of White" target="_blank">Snow Fall page</a> anyway). You&#8217;ll see that they added elevation lines, toned back the background sound a bit and added a faint &#8220;tick&#8221; to help show the speed of the avalanche as it moved down the mountain. </p>
