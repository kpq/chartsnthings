<p>Closing ceremonies are this weekend, which means the Olympics are almost over.</p>
<p>As many readers/skimmers/aggregators of Chartsnthings might know, the New York Times graphics department published <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/08/06/sports/olympics/olympic-graphics-collection.html" title="damn" target="_blank">one or two things</a> about the Olympics recently, and I&#8217;ll try to post little tidbits where I can instead of making a few massive posts.</p>
<p>What better place to start than in the Olympic pool, where we last left our <a href="http://chartsnthings.tumblr.com/post/24994361059/making-mistakes-outside-the-chart" title="flags" target="_blank">flags on our Speedos</a>? (Sorry about that one.)</p>
