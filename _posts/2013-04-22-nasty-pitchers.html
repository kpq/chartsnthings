<p>A couple weeks back, we used <a href="http://www.brooksbaseball.net/" title="PitchFX" target="_blank">PitchFX data</a> to show the relative &#8220;nastiness&#8221; (for lack of a better word) of the Mets&#8217; pitcher Matt Harvey. The chart below shows pitches that batters swung at outside the strike zone during a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/12/sports/baseball/mets-matt-harvey-and-his-fastball-earn-notice.html" title="NYT story" target="_blank">recent game</a> against the Phillies.Â </p>
<p><span>I made some sketches, Joe Ward did the rest:</span></p>
