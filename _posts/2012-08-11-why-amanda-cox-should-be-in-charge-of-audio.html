<p>The last few seconds of the Bolt video might seem familiar to some of you, especially if you were a fan of NYT graphics in 2010 during the Vancouver Olympics. One graphic done during those Games, &#8220;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2010/02/26/sports/olympics/20100226-olysymphony.html">Fractions of a Second: An Olympic Musical</a>" by Amanda Cox, let users hear the difference between finishers. It was a totally new and awesome way of thinking about close results. At least, it was new to me.</p>
<p>Anyway, we thought it would be cool to employ a similar effect for the sprinters, so I asked Amanda for a hand. (Duh.) An hour later, she sent me a folder titled &#8220;why amanda should not be in charge of audio,&#8221; which pretty much proves why Amanda should always be in charge of audio.</p>
<p>This is about 20 percent of the folder but it has most of the fun ones. Also, FYI, the order of the highlights in this one is screwed up&#8230;we had to fix it later.</p>
