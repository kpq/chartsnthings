<div>I <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/18/pageoneplus/corrections-november-18.html?_r=1&amp;ref=corrections#p%5BAamTto%5D" title="Correction" target="_self">screwed up</a> a print map yesterday. </div>
<blockquote>
<div><span>"And </span><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/17/us/politics/feuding-hurts-republicans-hopes-to-win-senate.html">a map</a><span> with the article mislabeled, in some editions, the state in the upper left corner of the contiguous United States that is considered solidly Democratic.  It is Washington, not Oregon. (Though the outcome of some races may be in doubt, one thing is for certain: Oregon will always be solidly under Washington.)&#8221;</span></div>

<div>Exporting and then formatting labels from Arcmap or R or whatever you map in is always better than writing them by hand. I love print, but unlike the web, you can&#8217;t fix something once it&#8217;s out there.  Brutal.</div>
