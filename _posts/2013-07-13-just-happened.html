<p><span>100% no lie</span></p>
<p><span>Was just at a sandwich place outside work, chatting with a co-worker about an upcoming map project. Co-corker leaves. A guy in the sandwich place walks up to me, asks me if I make maps. I tell him yes, sort of, sometimes. He says he loves maps. I say, cool, me too. Then he says, You know what would be really cool is, a map of quiet places in New York. I say are you messing with me? He says no. I say, are you joking? He says no. I then tell him that in the last day or two the Times published THIS EXACT MAP. I then watched his mind get blown in slow motion.</span></p>
<p><span>The map in question is &#8220;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/newsgraphics/2013/quiet/#/map/" title="Finding the Quiet City" target="_blank">Finding the Quiet City</a>,&#8221; a nice collection of video snapshots and reader suggestions by <a href="http://hellofromcath" title="catherine" target="_blank">Catherine Spangler</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/sjwilliams" title="Josh Williams">Josh Williams</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Rueby" title="Emily Reub" target="_blank">Emily Rueb </a>and <a href="https://twitter.com/blueshirt" title="Jeremy" target="_blank">Jeremy White</a>.</span></p>

<p><span>I had a journalism professor once say he knew he had written a good article when he overheard people talking about it in the supermarket. This seems sort of like that.</span> </p>
