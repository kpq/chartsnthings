<p>My colleague Graham Roberts is teaching <a href="http://www.skillshare.com/classes/design/Animated-Information-Graphics-Using-Data-and-Motion-to-Reveal-the-Story/1100008111?via=profile" title="Skillshare">a SkillShare class about animated motion graphics</a>. It&#8217;s only $20. If you&#8217;re interested in this sort of thing, it&#8217;s probably worth not drinking those three beers and spending the money on Graham instead.  (I get nothing by posting this except his eternal gratitude, which means maybe next time we do a narrated video I&#8217;ll win the fight and he&#8217;ll cut all the background music.) </p>
<p>These kind of storytelling skills are pretty hard to come by. If you have them, your portfolio looks like <a href="http://www.grahaphics.com/" title="Grahams portfolio" target="_blank">Graham&#8217;s</a>. If you don&#8217;t, you could be stuck making broken 2D Sankey diagrams like this one for the rest of your career:</p>
