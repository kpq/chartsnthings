<p>Part of this blog is intended to show the processes behind our work, including bad ideas. (Especially bad ideas.) But screw-ups don&#8217;t happen just in charts. For example, here&#8217;s a recent, not-really-verbatim conversation I had with my colleague <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/Grahaphics" title="Graham" target="_blank">Graham Roberts</a> as we looked at visualizing swimmers for an upcoming Olympics project:</p>
<div>
<p>GR: &#8220;We need a decent way to identify these guys.&#8221;</p>
<p>KQ: &#8220;What if we put a flag on their bathing suits?&#8221;</p>
<p>GR: &#8220;Like on their Speedos? Wouldn&#8217;t that be weird?&#8221;</p>
<p>KQ: &#8220;Not really.&#8221;</p>
<p>GR: &#8220;Really?&#8221;</p>
<p>KQ: &#8220;Let&#8217;s just see what it looks like.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>KQ: &#8220;So, no flags, huh.&#8221;</p>
<p>GR: &#8220;Yeah.&#8221;</p>
