<p>Notes like these are always lying around the office:</p>
<p><img align="middle" alt="head nodding" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8170/8055207412_7cef8363c8_b.jpg" width="705"/></p>
<p>In this case, the note refers to the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/10/02/us/politics/what-romney-and-obamas-body-language-says-to-voters.html?hp" title="What Romney and Obamas Body Language Says to Voters" target="_blank">analysis of Barack Obama and Mitt Romney&#8217;s body language</a> by some of my colleagues.</p>
