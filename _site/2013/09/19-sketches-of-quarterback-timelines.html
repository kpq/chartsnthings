<h2>19 Sketches of Quarterback Timelines</h2>

<div class="post">
<p>On Sunday Eli Manning started his 150th consecutive game for the Giants, the highest active streak in the NFL and the third-longest streak in NFL history. (One of the other two people above him is his brother, Peyton.)</p>
<p>The graphics department published <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/newsgraphics/2013/09/28/eli-manning-milestone/?ref=sports" title="link">an interactive graphic</a> that put Eli&#8217;s streak in the context of about 2,000 streaks from about 500 pro quarterbacks. The graphic lets you explore the qbs and search for any quarterback or explore a team to go down memory lane for your team.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not particularly important news, but the data provided by pro-football-reference is incredibly detailed and the concept lended itself to a variety of sketches. It was also good practice sketching in D3, which, once you memorize a few things, isn&#8217;t as painful as I had thought. (Being in SF for the fall makes learning easier, too, since I can interrupt Mike more easily when he&#8217;s sitting one desk over. )</p>
<p>A couple bar charts in R. First, total games started (this compares Eli to QBs in his draft class or later).</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2806/10008021916_88d8201883_c.jpg"/></p>
<p>And percent of games started (the people are 100% are players like Andrew Luck or RGIII who just haven&#8217;t played a lot of seasons.)</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5504/10007979445_c01787c2bc_c.jpg"/></p>
<p>Ported to a browser, just using total starts:</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5344/10007953384_488520ed49_c.jpg"/></p>
<p>And share of total possible starts</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7405/10008083793_a541096946_c.jpg"/></p>
<p>A different angle, showing teams with all the QBs who have started for them since 2004. (Sorry, Cleveland Browns.)</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5516/10007951554_f13659d788_c.jpg"/></p>
<p>A similar idea, but mapping when each quarterback played for a particular team</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3751/10008463133_f91bc0d747_c.jpg"/></p>
<p>Or just showing all the quarterbacks, regardless of team, going back to 2004&#8230;</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5512/10007951994_d34f7c8aed_c.jpg"/></p>
<p>&#8230;or all the way back to 1970</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5330/10007980935_d925d840db_c.jpg"/></p>
<p>Focuing on the teams took up less space, with a new color for each new QB. (Please wear sunglasses.)</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3742/10010309474_f90024b81a_b.jpg"/></p>
<p>Simplifying the output, only labeling prominent quarterbacks:</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5534/10008025006_80057ba64d_c.jpg"/><img alt="image" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3787/10010309264_445781c651_c.jpg"/><img alt="image" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7334/10007955774_1fffaf4793_c.jpg"/></p>
<p>At this point this was the general thought, but there were still some thougts on what the bars could look like. Lines were one option:</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5502/10007956444_6c38a114cc_c.jpg"/></p>
<p>And then some more streak-like streaks, which eventually became more like arrows and less like, I don&#8217;t know, whatever you think <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/09/25/sports/americas-cup-course.html">these</a> look like:</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7292/10008086883_deb6f9063f_c.jpg"/><img alt="image" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3777/10008028006_7c7b3ae05f_c.jpg"/><img alt="image" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5536/10008087963_0d18cd2530_c.jpg"/><img alt="image" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5448/10007957824_67e166a4ac_c.jpg"/><img alt="image" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7388/10007986835_c489cb91de_c.jpg"/></p>
<p>And the eventual one published Sunday, with search and fullscreen mode:</p>
