<h2>Before and After: Analyzing ESPN "SportsCenter" Transcripts</h2>

<div class="post">
<p>A couple weeks ago, just in time for the Super Bowl, we published a couple fun graphics that used transcripts of ESPN&#8217;s &#8220;SportsCenter&#8221; as a way to look back on the NFL season. </p>
<p>Originally, I had a concept in mind very similar to the one <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2010/07/02/sports/soccer/facebook-worldcup.html" title="world cup facebook" target="_blank">we (mostly Shan Carter) did in 2010</a> for the World Cup.</p>

<p>A colleague suggested instead using 3D players rather than photos, in part just to do something new and in part to give us a way to put more players on a field at one time. Here&#8217;s a progression of sketches on that concept:</p>
<p>Original whiteboard sketch:</p>
<p><img align="middle" alt="bad drawing" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7192/6866447173_080a34da78_z.jpg" width="640"/></p>
<p>A drawing for how it would fit on a print page:</p>

<p>Graham Roberts&#8217;s proof of concept (with sizes semi-randomly assigned):</p>
<p><img align="middle" alt="Proof of concept" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7061/6866446431_0096387eb1_b.jpg" width="1024"/></p>
<p>We added some labels and charts to Graham&#8217;s final rendering:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/02/04/sports/football/most-mentioned-players-on-espn.html" title="mentions" target="_blank"><img align="middle" alt="final render" height="1024" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7183/6905282377_2b8975e142_b.jpg" width="800"/></a></p>
<p>It ended up looking pretty cool and we were happy with it, but in the course of our analysis we really noticed a lot of funny quotes and cliches that the announcers said but I couldn&#8217;t really find an interesting way to present them.</p>
<p>We made a ton of charts looking for keywords we wanted to inspect, which let us sift through the data a little faster (though eventually we would have to weed out non-NFL references by hand). This output showed charts for mentions of words, both cumulative and week-by-week, along with a list of the usage of each word in context:</p>
<p><img align="middle" alt="report" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7066/6866446729_c92413449f_b.jpg" width="776"/></p>
<p>But presenting them was kind of a challenge. A straightforward approach (the only kind I know how to do, really) didn&#8217;t do much for anyone and took up a ton of space, so we dumped it:</p>
<p><img align="middle" alt="dullard" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7053/6866446509_ed270ea5a4_b.jpg" width="842"/></p>
<p>We tried highlighting individual sentences (like &#8220;You&#8217;ll have more luck getting a ticktack out of the mouth of an alligator than getting information, especially about injuries, out of the mouth of Bill Belichick,&#8221; Aug. 10), but there wasn&#8217;t anything cohesive about a random list of quotes.</p>
<p>Then my boss said to write something original with the quotes as if I were writing for <a href="http://www.mcsweeneys.net/tendency" title="mcsweeneys" target="_blank">McSweeney&#8217;s</a>. I said, great idea, imagining something like &#8220;<a href="http://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/question-1-is-it-ok-to-dunk-on-the-president" title="Is it OK to dunk on the president?" target="_blank">Is It OK To Dunk On the President?</a>&#8221;, one of my favorite McSweeney&#8217;s articles ever. Unfortunately, I couldn&#8217;t get it to work. Luckily, our intern, Ritchie King, who was already helping me with the analysis, was.</p>
<p>He turned a handful of silly cliches into a hilarious narrative about sports, war and Tim Tebow. We made his cliches piece the center of the graphic and had Sam Sifton read it online. (If you haven&#8217;t heard it yet, it&#8217;s <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/02/04/sports/football/a-compilation-of-sportscenter-cliches.html" title="sc cliches" target="_blank">worth a listen</a>.)</p>

<p>Anyway, it was a fun project and proof that data is out there for almost any crazy idea. It also emphasized two important lessons. One, from Amanda Cox, is that you should make a hundred charts and pick the best one. We definitely did that – our project folder is full of boring analysis of various players and ideas. The second lesson is that the design and editing machine of the NYT graphics department can take a decent idea and turn it into something much better.</p>
<p>For the nerds out there, most of the analysis was done in R using the <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tm/index.html" title="tm" target="_blank">tm</a>, <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/openNLP/index.html" title="openNLP" target="_self">openNLP</a> and <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rstem/index.html" title="rstem" target="_blank">Rstem</a> packages, but I can&#8217;t be sure which methods I used from which since Amanda just told me to import all of them.</p>
