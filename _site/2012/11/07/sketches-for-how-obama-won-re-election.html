<h2>Sketches for How Obama Won Re-election</h2>

<div class="post">
<p>Election night is (mercifully) over. Aside from the dozens of maps, tables and charts that ran live during the election, including a bunch live graphical updates to the live blog (some of which I reblogged here last night), the department also published a more analytical piece this morning.</p>
<p>There had been many sketches and ideas about what to do for the &#8220;How the Winner Won&#8221; graphic (Amanda made at least 40 ideas, some of which she might share someday), but by the end of the night there was a pretty good plan.</p>
<p>This sketch, by Steve Duenes, doesn&#8217;t show all the research or failed ideas that got us to this point, but it does show a clear plan that was eventually executed overnight by about ten graphics editors. The main map, by Mike Bostock and Shan Carter, was a variation on earlier maps we had published, including the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2010/11/03/us/politics/election-results-house-shift.html" title="house shifts" target="_blank">map of House shifts in 2010</a> (which itself was part of the Times&#8217;s <a href="http://elections.nytimes.com/2012/results/president" title="election mbloch maps" target="_blank">election app</a> this year) with some clear inspiration by Fernanda Viégas and Martin Wattenberg&#8217;s <a href="http://hint.fm/wind/" title="wind map" target="_blank">wind map</a>. </p>
<p>Anyway, here&#8217;s the sketch:  </p>

<p>And what was on the NYTimes homepage this morning:</p>
