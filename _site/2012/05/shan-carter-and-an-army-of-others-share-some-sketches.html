<h2>Shan Carter (and an army of others) share some sketches from the NYT electoral map</h2>

<div class="post">
<p>Last week the Times published their interactive <a href="http://elections.nytimes.com/2012/electoral-map" title="Electoral Map 2012" target="_blank">electoral map</a>. Although a medium-sized team of reporters, editors, designers and developers (including, but not limited to, <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/jashkenas" title="Ashkenas" target="_blank">Jeremy Ashkenas</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/mericson" title="Matt Ericson" target="_blank">Matt Ericson</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/alanmclean" title="Alan McLean" target="_blank">Alan McLean</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/swannodette" title="David Nolen" target="_blank">David Nolen</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/derekwillis" title="Top." target="_blank">Derek Willis</a>) had a hand in designing and building the project, <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/shancarter" title="Shan Carter" target="_blank">Shan Carter</a> did much of the developing of the main visualization, and he agreed to let me post some of his sketches here. (I had no hand in this – I&#8217;m just the image copy-paster this evening.)</p>
<p>First, a look back to the Times&#8217; <a href="http://elections.nytimes.com/2008/president/whos-ahead/key-states/map.html" title="2008 map" target="_blank">electoral map of 2008</a>:</p>
<p><img align="middle" alt="2008 Map" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7092/7200190984_98161ff2e5_c.jpg" width="800"/></p>
<p>You&#8217;ll notice some similarities – there is analysis for every state and the option to share your own map. But they wanted to explore some different options this year, too. First, Shan started by making a cartogram in Illustrator, overlaid on a (pretty terrible) hand trace of the US:</p>
<p><img align="middle" alt="First map sketch" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8167/7200084354_9636749580_o.png" width="728"/></p>
<p>And then slowly tinkering with it:</p>
<p><img align="middle" alt="Testy" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7240/7200625954_33ba561dbf_o.jpg" width="640"/></p>
<p><img align="middle" alt="Improvement" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7088/7200084486_ef8897661f_c.jpg" width="800"/></p>
<p>One idea was to take the geography out of the graphic completely:</p>
<p><img align="middle" alt="NO GEO" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5330/7200084300_58f1364574_b.jpg" width="648"/></p>
<p>Or at least minimize it further by dividing states into regions:</p>
<p><img align="middle" alt="Minimized geo" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5236/7200084690_9063651ac6_c.jpg" width="800"/></p>
<p>Another was to compare two maps side-by-side, similar to the <a href="http://elections.nytimes.com/2010/results/senate" title="split screen senate" target="_blank">"split screen" view</a> of the Senate in 2008:</p>
<p><img align="middle" alt="Split screen img" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5114/7200084740_bbc2ae31f1_c.jpg" width="800"/></p>
<p>But no one was really super thrilled with maps as the main conduit for the analysis. Instead, they decided on minimizing the geography and using &#8220;bins&#8221; for states. (Shan has sort of been obsessed with &#8220;bins&#8221; since 2008, when his dream of having states magically fall into buckets on election night ultimately didn&#8217;t pan out. I personally had to cheer him up after that and it was not pretty.)</p>
<p>Anyway, an early prototype of that concept:</p>
<div><img align="middle" alt="prototype" height="530" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7243/7200085234_687c5a4624_c.jpg" width="800"/>And how that part of the graphic ultimately looked:</div>
<p><img align="middle" alt="Final blobs" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7079/7200861832_998e269f29_c.jpg" width="800"/></p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve seen <a href="http://elections.nytimes.com/2012/electoral-map" title="final interactive" target="_blank">this piece</a> by now, you&#8217;ll notice that they didn&#8217;t make just one decision – they expanded on a few of them in a compelling mix of interactive and linear storytelling that told a few different stories and also let you make your own and share it wherever you wanted.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also a fun insight into Shan&#8217;s workflow, which is to mostly experiment directly with markup rather than with flat outputs from R or Adobe Illustrator mockups, which many of us do. (OK, technically, he tells me the cartograms, being more art than science, were hand-made in Illustrator and then their xy positions were exported to D3, but still, he&#8217;s on the record saying &#8220;mockups are for suckers.&#8221;)</p>
<p>Also, this was made <a href="http://d3js.org/" title="D3" target="_blank">using D3</a> and implemented a technique that let the graphic function properly even in Internet Explorer 8. (A sharp guy named Jim Vallandingham <a href="http://vallandingham.me/d3_without_svg.html" title="no svg" target="_blank">chronicled this in extreme detail</a> if you&#8217;re interested in doing this sort of thing.)</p>
