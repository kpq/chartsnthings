<h2>Before and After: 2010 House Elections</h2>

<div class="post">
<p>I&#8217;ve shown this image in a variety of settings, and has been was explained in depth a few times by Amanda Cox, who did most of the work, but I&#8217;m posting it here because it&#8217;s one of the favorite things I&#8217;ve ever drawn. (Admittedly, the bar is set low.)</p>

<p>I like this drawing for two reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It&#8217;s easy proof that I&#8217;m from Minnesota. Â (The Lake of the Woods looms large in our world; I also forgot Texas completely and had to make another pass.)</p></li>
<li><p>It&#8217;s strong evidence that you don&#8217;t have to be able to draw to make graphics.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Before:</p>

<p>After (and here&#8217;s the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2010/11/03/us/politics/election-results-house-shift.html?ref=politics" title="Online version" target="_blank">online version)</a>:</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve always liked seeing the final product next to some of the first sketches; they&#8217;re usually kind of elegant. I&#8217;ll post more as I come across them.</p>
